# What factors affect a person's commitment to honoring his/her Doctor's appointment?
Alot of times, people go to hospitals owing to concerns about their health. They appear to be badly in need medical attention but, right after booking appointments, many do not show up for it. What could be responsible for this?

In order to understand this phenomena, I've picked a case study with dataset. This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

## Why this project?
The sole purpose of this project is, investigating a real life data in order to solve real life problems.
